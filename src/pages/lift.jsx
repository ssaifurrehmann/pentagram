          A very dangerous but also very avoidable hazard in the construction workplace is a lift hazard. Lift hazards are related to any equipment that lifts or is being lifted on the site.<strong> Lifting hazards on the construction site include: faulty lifting equipment, wire electrocution, falling from heights, tip-overs, and falling objects</strong>.

          How to Prevent a Lift Hazard:
        </h1>
        <h2>
        <strong>Be mindful of Apparatus</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
        Any apparatus you bring along with you when being lifted can be dropped to the risk of any worker below when not attended. Workers must ensure no equipment is unsupervised.
        </p>
          <h2>
        <strong>Maintenance</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
         Have a frequent maintenance of all lifting machinery to ensure all machinery poses no threat beyond expected when under usage.
        </p>
          <h2>
        <strong>Safety equipment</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
        Wear safety equipment such as safety ropes when being lifted to prevent injuries in case of a fall.
        </p>
         <h2>
        <strong>Prevent Tip-overs</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
        Be mindful of any lifting machinery prone to tip-overs. Perhaps more dangerous than a equipment and/or a worker falling, tip-overs are at risk of both the operating works as well as any other works nearby on the site of the tip-over. All workers must work together to ensure no such dangers can occur at anytime on site.        </p>
