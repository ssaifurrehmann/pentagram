        Right to protective equipment free of charge
        </h2>
        <p>
         equipments such as respirators, goggles, earplugs, and gloves along with other types of personal protective equipment that are commonly used must be provided by employers free of charge. Employers are responsible for knowing when the protective equipment is needed.

        In the event of a dangerous situation
        </h2>
        <p>
        If there is a dangerous situation at work, employees are recommended to bring the conditions to the attention of the employers as soon as possible. A worker who refuses in good faith to expose themselves to a dangerous condition, they are protected from subsequent retaliation. <strong>The condition must be where a reasonable person would conclude a real danger of death or serious harm</strong>
