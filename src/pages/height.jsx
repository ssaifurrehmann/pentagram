          Height related incidents account for 
          most construction site incidents. They 
          can be a result of faulty and unstable 
          surfaces or the lack of proper 
          equipment. There is a lot of 
          equipment necessary for the workplace to stay safe for all individuals. Visit the scaffolding tab for more information on scaffolding construction hazards.

          <strong>Use the Right Ladder for the Job</strong>
        </h2>
          <p>
            There a lot of aspects necessary to consider the safest ladder for the job. First, <strong>consider the type of ladder</strong>, which includes basic types such as stepladders and extension ladders, but also specific ladders including telescope, platform, twin step, scaffolding, and tripod. Each of these have different properties and exist for different situations. Next, <strong>ensure the height of the ladder is correct</strong>. An example is that for extension ladders, they should be 7 to 10 feet longer than the desired length. Also, <strong>ensure the performance rating of the ladder is high enough </strong> to hold all of the equipment the workers will need; do not ever exceed the weight limit. And finally, <strong>make sure the material is correct for the job,</strong> for example, a metal ladder isn't the best for a place with lots of electrical components.

          <strong>Place Guard rails at all Unprotected Openings</strong>
        </h2>
          <p>
            The best way to get rid of falling hazards is to place guard rails at all unprotected openings. These guardrails must be between <strong>39 and 45 inches above the surface</strong>, where the <strong>top rails can hold up to 200lbs of force</strong> and the <strong>medium rails can hold up 150lbs or force. </strong>
          </p>
        <h2>
          <strong>Safety Nets or Personal Fall Arrest Systems</strong>
        </h2>
          <p>
            When guard rails arenâ€™t an option, there must be a system in place for workers to protected in the case of an incident. These could be either safety nets or personal fail arrest systems. Safety nets should be <strong>as close as possible to the work site</strong>, as well as <strong>no more than 30 feet below the site</strong>. The personal fall arrest system, consisting of anchorage, connectors, a body belt, a deacceleration device, and other things, could be used by all workers. They must be <strong>inspected before each use</strong> and should be <strong>small enough to ensure the user will not come in contact with the ground</strong>.
