        Material Exposure Hazards

          There are many materials that can become an issue with even a small amount of exposure. They can often cause harm to many or all the workers on site, and in some cases can cause damage to nearby unrelated areas including residents. Because of this, material exposure is one of the most important hazards to consider while on the job.

          <strong>Stay Up to Date with Materials Being Used</strong>
        </h2>
          <p>
            Each work site will have different materials based on the job, so it is important to know what your site has in detail. Some of the most common materials to worry about include solvents, dust, mineral fibers, and mold. Solvents, usually found in paints, adhesives, and cleaning fluids, can affect the nervous system when ingested or in contact with the skin. Dust, which includes silica dust and wood dust, among others, can not only affect workersâ€™ lungs but create pollution issues for neighboring areas depending on the quantity. Mineral fibers, used usually for sound and temperature insulation, include fibers coming from glass, ceramic, rockwool, and slag wool, can cause irritation in the lungs, eyes, and skin. Finally, mold not only can be dangerous for anyone with respiratory system issues including asthma and allergies, but it also can break down building materials, causing the construction site to be more dangerous as a whole.

          <strong>Work in Open Environments When Possible</strong>
        </h2>
          <p>
            Most of these materials, while still dangerous in small amounts, become significantly more of a threat when in large quantities. One of the safest ways to prevent this is to lower the chance of high concentration of these materials. Working in open environments can let the materials diffuse, letting fresh air be more accessible for workers. Closed environments are dangerous and cause serious health issues with prolonged exposure. 
          </p>
        <h2>
          <strong>Wear Personal Protective Equipment</strong>
        </h2>
          <p>
            There is specific personal protective equipment for almost all the materials described above. This equipment is made for people who must be prolonged to dangerous chemicals and materials for a long amount of time in closed environments. It is important to ensure this equipment for all workers who may possibility be at risk.
          </p>
          <h2>
          <strong>Deep Cleaning When the Job is Done</strong>
        </h2>
          <p>
            One of the most important ways to prevent personal damage by material exposure is to have a deep cleaning when done being exposed to the work environment. This can include prolonged hand washing or a shower, as contamination of food, drinks, or other items and objects can cause dangerous effects and disease even long after leaving the work environments.
