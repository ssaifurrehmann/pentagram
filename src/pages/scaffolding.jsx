          Related to the hazards regarding height, scaffolding related hazards have to do with the dangers when working on a scaffold. These issues, however, have to do a lot more with ensuring a quality constructed scaffolding and maintaining this quality.

          How to Prevent a Scaffolding Hazard:

        <h2>
          <strong>Ensure Secureness of the Scaffolding</strong>
        </h2>
          <p>
            Prior to using scaffolding, it is important to ensure it is built safely and effectively. The footing should always be level and rigid, while also being able to support the workload for the specific job. The equipment should never sway or move, and so the bracing must be tight and effective. Additionally, toe boards should be present on the side of railing to ensure nothing falls off the scaffolding.
          </p>
        <h2>
          <strong>Do Frequent Checks of the Scaffolding</strong>
        </h2>
          <p>
            Even if the scaffolding is perfectly built prior to use, it can wear down which can create issues down the road. It is important that someone knowledgeable and educated with scaffolding construction check the state of it prior to each shift at a minimum. It also doesn’t hurt to ensure checks more often.
          </p>
        <h2>
          <strong>Pay Attention to Capacity and Other Limits</strong>
        </h2>
          <p>
            It is important to pay attention to the limits of the scaffolding. There is almost always a defined maximum capacity (and if there isn’t, there should be). If new equipment is needed that would go beyond this limit, don’t push the limit and instead remove equipment not currently required. It is also helpful to test certain equipment on the scaffolding in a safe environment to ensure vibrations and other possible effects don’t cause issues with the structure.
