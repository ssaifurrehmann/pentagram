        Electric Hazards

          Electrical hazards are a commonplace threat in most if not all construction sites. Over 1000 electrical workers die each year from electrical hazards according the Los Alamos National Lab. The use of electrical equipment presents hazards in the forms of: <strong>overhead power lines, damaged equipment and wires, improper grounding, wet electric equipment, and failure to use flame retardant materials and electrical insulation.</strong>

          How to Prevent an Electric Hazard:
        </h1>
        <h2>
        <strong>Wire Maintenance</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
        Proper maintenance of electrical wires is crucial to workplace safe from electrical hazards. Wires are one of the most common components in electrical based workplaces, so failure to survey and maintain their stability can result in injury
        </p>
          <h2>
        <strong>Be Aware of Faulty Equipment</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
        When not careful of faulty electrical equipment and wires, workers can unintentionally lose their lives or result in serious injuries to their bodies if electrocuted.
        </p>
          <h2>
        <strong>Grounding and Insulation</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
        Using proper grounding and insulation for both heat and electrical can help prevent or reduce any injuries caused by the two. Use of electricity insulating gloves or flame retardant clothing can potentially save a worker from serious injury or even death.
