          It is important to ensure every worksite has all the necessary tools and equipment to keep the worksite safe for all workers and emplpoyees. This is <strong>not</strong> a comprehensive list of all tools for your worksite, but a list of some of the most important and universal ones for construction workers.
        </p>
        <h2>
        <strong>Hard Hats</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
        These are one of the most commonly seen forms of personal construction equipment for a reason. It is important to keep a hard hat on when there are many playing parts all around you, especially above. Unpredictable things occur, including items falling from high scaffolding and other areas, so it is important to keep your head protected.
        </p>
        <h2>
        <strong>Hearing Protection</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
        Any form of ear plugs made for construction site use is important in preventing incidents regarding dangerously loud noises. Go to the <a href="/#/Noise">Noise Hazards</a> page here to learn more.
        </p>
          <h2>
        <strong>Full Face Shields</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
        These are important when working with anything that can cause problems when launched back in your face, like large amounts of dust. It's a good idea to keep these on hand for when the job requires it.
        </p>
          <h2>
        <strong>Chemical Splash Goggles</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
        Similar to the full face shields, these can help protect your eyes from dangerous chemicals in the event that they are splashed in your face. They cover less than the shield but is most likely more secure.   
        </p>
        <h2>
        <strong>Respiratory Protection</strong>
          </h2>
          <p>
        Any form of a respirator can help from breathing in dangerous chemicals and dusts. This, as well as the shields and goggles, are the most ideal when the worker is in a closed environment with limited access to fresh air.
