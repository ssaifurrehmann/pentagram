          Noise hazards are hazards that can affect the human hearing system. Construction sites are intensive workplaces where loud equipment such as <strong>chainsaws, generators, bulldozers, electric drills, and metal fabrication machines</strong> can pose a threat to your auditory system

          How to Prevent a Noise Hazard:
        </h1>
        <h2>
        <strong>Wear Headgear</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
        It is important to wear headgear or any type of construction site approved earplugs to protect your ears when in the middle of the job.
        </p>
          <h2>
        <strong>Integrate Safety Signs</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
         Companies must establish signs to warn workers of high noise intensity equipment being used nearby on site. Signs must be visible and informative while being placed in proper locations to prevent any workers missing the signs.
        </p>
          <h2>
        <strong>Power off Machinery</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
        Powering of loud machinery when not under use is a way to save both energy and chances of noise hazard injuries to workers. Prolonged exposure to loud, powered machinery is aa main cause of noise hazard related injuries.
        </p>
         <h2>
        <strong>Purchase quieter machines</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
        Having employers purchase quieter machinery could greatly reduce the danger levels of noise hazards, especially when worked in conjunction with headwear such as earplugs or noise cancelling headphones. Though a tradeoff for efficiency in some instances, shift to quieter working tools will assist in the prevention of noise hazards.
