This web application is made up of multiple pages, which can be found in the pages folder.
These pages correspond with different informational hazard pages, that display important
reminder and details regarding safety, as well as pages focusing on mental health and the rights
of workers.

Additionally, users can report incidents to be displayed on the home page, which are used to
discover the most common and urgent safety concerns at the construction. The location on the
reported incidents links to the coordinates of the users location on Google Maps.

The routes for navigating the pages are located in the router.jsx file, with many stylizing details,
including the background image and text specifications, are within the styles.css file.
